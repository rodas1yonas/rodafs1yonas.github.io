    <h1>The Christian Highland Kingdom</h1>
    <p>
                 The legend of Queen Sheba and King Solomon was not the major factor for the success of Yekuno Amlak in 1270. He was said to have built a strong army, by which he launched successive military expeditions against the Zagwe rulers. The maintenance of strong army presupposes economic strength, which might have been acquired from the Zeila trade route passing through the Amhara land.</p>
    <p> The control over the Zeila trade route helped Yekumo – Amlak to strengthen his economic power. The economic strength in turn helped him to organize and sustain strong army. This economic and military strength contributed much to his success in defeating the Zagwe king and to inaugurate a new ruling dynasty.</p>
    <p>   Like the Zagwe rulers, the kings of the new Solomonic dynasty maintained the political and cultural traditions of Aksum.  They continued to expand Christianity in different directions. The rulers exercised both political and religious powers at the same time. The church–state relationship became very strong and almost reached its peak during this period.</p>
    <p> One very important development of this period was the large scale territorial expansion of the Christian kingdom. In 1270, when it came to power, the Christian kingdom was confined to the territory that consisted of southern Eritrea, Tigrai, Lasta and northern part of Shewa. From this area Yekuno Amlak and his successors began to expand the territory of the new dynasty. Its territorial limits covered the ancient highland provinces of Aksum and Zagwe in the north. It also covered the regions of Gonder and eastern Gojjam in the north west, Bizamo and Damot in the south west, the Gurage lands and the Omotic populations of Walayta and Gamo in the south and Ifat, Fatagar, Dawaro, Hadya and Bali in the east and south east.</p>
    <p>   In order to effectively administer over this vast territory, the Christian kingdom consolidated a feudal system of administration known as the gult system. Under this system state officials were granted right of collecting tribute (called the gult right) from the local peasantry. Gult right is a right given to an official to share in the produce of the peasantry. An official who was give this right by the state was known as bale-gult or gult owner. Peasants are given to him based on his rank in state hierarchy. The bale- gult enjoyed a number of political and economic privileges over the peasants under him. He had the right to collect tributes in kind and use them to maintain himself and his family. He could also use labor of the peasants under him for different purposes. Moreover, he could recruited local army and command them in wars during period of local or national crises.</p>
<p> In return for all these privileges, the bale gult was responsible to maintain law and order in his area. So, this system greatly helped to simplify the task of administrating the vast Christian empire by dividing it in to smaller units. It also enables the Christian kingdom to maintain large territorial Army, which the kingdom used to bring the Muslim and other states under its control.</p>
<p>  A rest right is a claim to the hereditary ownership of land. Rest right was a communal birth right to land. The state provides them with security where as the peasants were obliged to pay tribute or gebber to the state. Gult right was given to a state official in return for his service to the state. So, it was a medieval substitute for salary and it lasted as for as the official remained loyal to the state. It was not hereditary. The gult system remained to be a predominant feature of Ethiopian feudalism for long period of time.</p>
<p>During this period, the Christian kingdom had no permanent capital like Aksum or Lalibela. It ruled over the vast territory through mobile courts for over two centuries. The kings, their armies, officials and their camp followers moved from region to region, where they established temporary camps. The area of Lake Hayq in Wallo, Manz, Tegulet and Bulga in northern Shewa; and Yarer and Ziquala in eastern Shewa served as temporary royal camps of administration in this period. The royal camps were moving from region to region to check rebellions in different parts of the empire and to control the security of the vast kingdom. The need to get daily food supply and firewood’s for such great number of court officials, soldiers and servants also necessitated the use of mobile camps.</p>
<p>The Christian highland rulers continued zagwes tradition of foreign relations with Egypt and the Middle East. They also extended these relations to Europe. Some sources show that numerous visitors from Egypt, Syria, Persia,  Italy, the Vatican, portugal and spain frequented the courts of the Christian kings during the period. More closer relations were, established with Portugal and spain.</p>
<p>Beside the highland Christian state outlined above, a number of other states emerged in the region of the Horn of Africa.</p>
  
  
    <h2 class="commondiv">The Muslim Sultanates</h2>
    <p>The penetration of Islam into Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, led to the emergence of many Muslim communities in the northern and southeastern Ethiopian regions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the northern Ethiopia the sultanate of Dahlak was emerged. It seemed to emerge at the beginning of the 10th C.A.D. It wasn't strong though.</li>
      <li >In the southeastern Ethiopia along the Zeila trade route several Muslim Sultanates had emerged. Some of those were

      </li></ul>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="commondiv">Other states</h2>
    <p>In the central and southern parts of the region there were also ststes and peoples with traditional religion. The most knoen ones were Damot, kaffa, Enraya, BIzamo, Walayta, Yem, Kambata, The Gurage Chiefdoms, and the agaw kingdom of Gojjam. </p>
    <h3>The Kingdom of kaffa</h3>
    <p>Kaffa was known at last since the end of the fourteenth century (1390-1897). It was an independent kingdom from the Christian Highland State. It was considered as the birth place of coffee. This dynasty came to an end during the unification process of Ethiopia led by Menelik II, under Tato Gaki Serecho. <br>

    </p>
    <h3>The Agaw Kingdom of Gojjam</h3>
    <p>
      This kingdom was predominantly Agaw speaking and located to the south of lake Tana. It exercised strong control over the lake and its islands. Many Christian kings made successive attempts to bring it under control. Finally Amde Seyon incorporated Gojjam in to the C.H.K. Since its request, Christianity was introduced to Gojjam, its people were Christianized and churches and monasteries were built in the Kingdom.
    </p>
    <h3>The Kingdom of Wallayta</h3>
    <p>The Wolaita tradition well
      remembers the kingdom as most organized
      and ruled by strong kings since the 13th
      century. For this tradition, the kingdom was
      ruling vast territories starting from the
      present area of Wolaita up to the central and
      northern areas of the country. Kindo Didaye
      one of the twelve districts or Woredas of
      Wolaita Zone, is the area of origin of the
      people and the Wolaita kingdom. Its
      territories diminished to the present area
      because of different factors among which
      the Oromo people’s migration and the
      challenge from the neighbouring rival
      peoples and states were the main ones.</p>
     
     <p>Sources indicate that before the
      conquest, four dynasties ruled over the
      kingdom of Wolaita. However, only the two
      dynasties: the Wolaita-Mala dynasty, which
      ruled from 13th to the end of the 15th
      century, and the Tigre dynasty that ruled
      from the 16th century until 1894, the time of
      conquest, are well remembered by Wolaita
      tradition. Wolaita is composed of more than
      one hundred clans.</p> 
      
     <p> The Wolaita kingdom was formed
      by various groups of peoples who came
      from the surrounding regions of Kambata,
      Hadya, Sidama, Dawuro, Gofa, Koyra,
      Qucha, and from far areas of Amhara and
      Tigray regions traveled to the area because
      of trade, war, marriage alliance and other
      reasons and settled in Wolaita.
      </p>

     <p>Although the exact time of the
      beginning of Wolaita kingdom started is not
      known due to lack of evidence, it seems
      logical to suggest that sometime between
      twelve and thirteenth centuries the Wolaita
      Malla dynasty was re-established and
      consolidated. Moreover, many writers
      consider this period as the period of the
      beginning of the Wolaita kingdom.</p> 
      <p>Kawo Tona Gaga, the last king of the Wolaita kingdom, was believed to be one of its greatest warriors and most powerful kings. Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia initially ordered Ras Mengesha Atikem of Gojjam to campaign south in order to feed his men, which put the Wolaita Kingdom in his crosshairs. However, they had experience building fortifications due to conflict with the Oromo people and repulsed the invasion. The new king Tona Gaga then set about raising an army personally loyal to him from "deposed castes and royal slaves." Menelik later marched south, calling on the king to pay tribute and spare his kingdom after reaching the border of Wolaita. Tona prepared his fortifications and refused negotiation. He also relied mistakenly upon understandings with the Oromo. Expertly dug defensive trenches and mounds crippled the initial assault, but encircling sweeps by Menelik's forces drove Tona Gaga onto the slopes of Mount Damota and he was soon caught between the Ethiopians and Oromo auxiliaries led by Ras Wolde Gyorgis, having been captured by a soldier of Negus Mikael. Abba Jifar II had sent the auxiliaries, betraying Tona Gaga. <br>
