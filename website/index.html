       <strong class="bold"> Ethiopia</strong>,</a> country on the Horn of Africa.
        The country lies completely within the tropical latitudes and is relatively compact, 
        with similar north-south and east-west dimensions. The capital is Addis Ababa (“New Flower”), 
        located almost at the centre of the country. Ethiopia is the largest and most populated country 
        in the Horn of Africa. With the 1993 secession of Eritrea, its former province along the Red Sea
        , Ethiopia became landlocked.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ethiopia is one of the world’s oldest countries, its territorial extent having varied over the 
        millennia of its existence. In ancient times it remained centred on Aksum, an imperial capital located in the northern
         part of the modern state, about 100 miles (160 km) from the Red Sea coast. The present territory was consolidated during 
         the 19th and 20th centuries as European powers encroached into Ethiopia’s historical domain. Ethiopia became prominent
          in modern world affairs first in 1896, when it defeated colonial Italy in the Battle of Adwa, and again in 1935–36,
           when it was invaded and occupied by fascist Italy.<br> 
        
        liberation during World War II by the Allied powers set the stage for Ethiopia to play a more prominent role 
        in world affairs. Ethiopia was among the first independent nations to sign the Charter of the United Nations,
         and it gave moral and material support to the decolonization of Africa and to the growth of Pan-African cooperation. 
         These efforts culminated in the establishment of the Organization of African Unity (since 2002, the African Union)
          and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, both of which have their headquarters in Addis Ababa.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ethiopia is bounded by Eritrea to the north, Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia to the east, Kenya to the south,
         and South Sudan and Sudan to the west.
    </p>
    <p>Ethiopia is a diverse cultural nation with a long and in an African context well-documented history.
         Ethiopia is the only country in Africa which has never been colonised.

Ethiopia is known to be the "cradle of humanity". Human kind is very likely to have its roots in Ethiopia.
 Lucy, the best preserved version of the predecessor to man is approximately 3,5 mio. years old, and has been
  found in the Ethiopian part of the Great Rift Valley. <br>

Ethiopia is one of the oldest Christian nations in the world. Christianity dates back to 300 ad, when the then
capital of Ethiopia, Aksum, was converted to Christianity. The Ethiopian orthodox church is thus one of the oldest in the world.
 Christianity is deeply rooted in Ethiopian history, but Islam also has roots in Ethiopia. Around 40% of Ethiopians are Muslim,
  and the two religions have co-existed peacefully ever since the first disciple of the Prophet Muhammad was granted protection 
  and residence in Ethiopia by the first king in Aksum. <br>

Ethiopia's history has been shaped by influence from both the Middle East and Africa. Early Ethiopian history was influenced by Egypt.
 There is a myth saying that the Queen of Sheba, who reigned in the Northern City of Ethiopia, Aksum, had a son with King Solomon. 
 The son was later pronounced as King Menelik I. According to the myth, Ethiopia has been ruled by descendants of King Menelik
  I up until the ousting of Kaiser Haile Selassie following the communist take-over of power in 1974. <br>

Haile Selassie I ruled as emperor from 1930 to 1974. In 1935 Italian troops occupied the country, and it was not until 1941
 that Ethiopia with the assistance of British troops were able to liberate Ethiopia again. In 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie was
  ousted by a communist military council, which in 1977 led to Mengistu Haile Mariam coming to power, where he became the
   leader of both the military council and the government. During the 1980's, under the rule of Mengistu, Ethiopia
    experienced some of the worst famines in the history of the country. Mengistu was overthrown in 1991 by guerrilla
     forces led by the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front. <br>

In 1991, a coalition of guerrilla groups formed Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front led by Former Prime 
Minister Meles Zenawi. The Ethiopian constitution, which was enacted in 1994, defines Ethiopia as an ethnic-based
 federal system and divides the country into 10 relatively autonomous regions.
  Ethiopia has had national parliamentary elections in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and latest in May 2015.
   From 1991 until August 2012 Meles Zenawi was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia. After his death on August 20th,
    the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hailemariam Desalegn was appointed interim Prime Minister, and he was re-elected 
    after the general election in May 2015. <br> <br>

Ethiopia went through a sweep of modernisation during the late 19th and early 20th century. During this time, Emperor 
Menelik II founded Addis Ababa as the new capital. Ethiopia was one of the original members of the United Nations.
 Ethiopia today hosts two of the three continental organisations, namely the African Union Commission headquarter
  and the UNs Economic Commission for Africa. This often leads to Addis Ababa being referred to as the "Capital of Africa".</p>
